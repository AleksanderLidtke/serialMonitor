## Overview

This is a graphical interface program that allows the user to communicate with an
Arduino or other piece of hardware via a serial port. It provides:
- a simple output window which contains all of the information being routed through
    the serial port
- a text box which allows the user to type in an arbitrary command and send it
    by pressing return
- a drop-down menu used to select the serial port
- a button used to update the list of available ports (e.g. after resetting the
    physical connection)
- text boxes used to update the refresh rate of the GUI and the conenction Baud rate
